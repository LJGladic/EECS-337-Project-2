How to use:
Main file is -> EECS337_Project2.py
1. Run the above file and follow the prompts.
2. First you can choose to enter either a recipe number or the whole recipe URL.
3. Then you can choose what transformation(s) to perform (vegetarian, healthy, unhealthy, indian and italian)
4. You can type '6' to exit.

Issues we can't control:
Random videos get added sometimes to the recipes as adds, so WATCH NOW gets added sometimes as a step, and will
mess with other steps.  This can get solved by just running the code again.
